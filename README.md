# Jarvis-voiceAssistant
This is a primary voice assistant which I made in the 3rd year of my college in Eclipse. This project aims at helping blind people to some extent, i.e., opening various apps, letting the user know current time &amp; date, send e-mails and many more activities which would provide some aid to the blind people while using computer.

The project has been made on ECLIPSE IDE 2018-09.
The specification of the system used to create this project is : OS - Windows 8.1, 32 bit ; RAM - 2GB ; ROM - 1TB.

Make sure you download all the JAR files used in the code from Internet. You can take help from YouTube videos as for each group of JAR file, there are videos available.  
After downloading all the JAR files, you have to add external JAR files to your project as referenced libraries in Eclipse. 

Next up, for the commands file you will have to create a .lm file and a dictionary file. Process for the same is :- 
  i) Search for Sphinx Knowledge Base Generator in google. Open the first link available.
  ii) Select browse on the screen and fetch the commands.txt file and add it, then click on compile knowledge base.
  iii) Save the .dic file and .lm file to your PC/Laptop and add it to the project. Do surely change the address for both these files in the code, so that          both the files are accessible in the system.
  iv) Connect a microphone to your system (USB mic recommended).
  v) Congratulations, you have created your own voice assistant. You can add more features to it and share them in the comment box.
  
Feel free to reach out in case of any issues.
