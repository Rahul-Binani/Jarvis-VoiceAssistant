# Jarvis-voiceAssistant
This is a primary voice assistant which I made in the 3rd year of my college. This project aims at helping blind people to some extent, i.e., opening various apps, letting the user know current time &amp; date, send e-mails and many more activities which would provide some aid to the blind people while using computer.
